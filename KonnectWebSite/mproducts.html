			<p class="j">eKonnect uses Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to produce mapped information for government, business, and the academia. These maps can be used for various purposes. For government, these can be used for tax administration, land use planning, investment and tourism promotion, resource management, infrastructure planning, and many others. Businesses can use these to study their markets, situate branches, locate customers and establish sales territories. Academics may use maps for their research and studies.

			<p class="pgreen">For Real Property, Business Establishments and Tourism</p>
			<br>

            <p class="j"><b>Map Explorer</b> is a web-based, GIS-enabled application that features interactive maps linked to a database. The MapExplorer can be linked to Business Permits and Licensing System (BPLS), Real Property Tax System (RPTS) and Tourism databases. The information from these databases is overlayed with GIS-map layers and can be manipulated using map tools.
            <br><br>
            
            The MapExplorer presents data and information in an attractive and highly visual manner. An advanced form of GIS, is capable of disseminating data, especially spatial data, widely over the internet for a wider audience.

			<p class="pgreen">electronic Business Permit and Licensing System</p>
			<br>

			<p class="j"><b>Electronic Business Permit and Licensing System</b> <i>(eBPLS)</i> is a web-based application that enables Local Government Unit (LGUs) to process business applications electronically. The system standardizes the process flow in the application of business and licenses. It provides faster turn-around time in the processing of business transactions. The tedious manual processes that required applicant follow-ups will be replaced by a system that enables applications, queries on approval status, as well as remaining tax dues in real-time.
			<br><br>

			The collections on business permits and licenses, being the primary source of income of LGUs, lay the bench-mark from which the plans and programs of a city or municipality are established.

			<p class="j"><b>Electronic Real Property Tax System</b> <i>(eRPTS)</i> facilitates easy assessment of the real property, as well as improve the LGU's tax enforcement capabilities. the RPTS allows onscreen viewing, online printing and other transactions.

            <h2><span id="oview"></span> Overview:</h2>
			<br>

			<p class="j">Users can compare the previous data to the current situation and readings from the field instruments with the rainfall recorded from a past typhoon event which caused flooding in a certain area. If there is similarity in reading, users can easily alarm and notify the areas of concern that possible flooding may occur any moment, or on a certain period of time.
			<br><br>

			Likewise, water levels in the open channels like rivers, dams, creeks, lakes and other water sheds can be measured automatically by Ultrasonic Water Level Sensors. This device can measure the water level and transmit the data back to command centre via broadband wireless or GSM/GPRS connection.
			<br><br>

			The transmitted data is analyzed, based on the configured alarm settings (i.e., <b>LOW, MEDIUM, WARNING, and HIGH</b>). From this alarm setting, the Command Centre can issue warnings to local officials - whether to stay or evacuate a certain area. Data gathered is being stored in a relational database located in the command centre. In a crucial situation, exchange of information should be precise and accurate - especially in a rugged environment.
			<br><br>
			
			We can also provide digital radio communication systems with a wider coverage, designed for extreme uses (like rescue operations) in all weather conditions. With this GPS enabled radio, the Command Centre can track the exact location and communicate this to the mobile units at the same time, enabling them to divert other units to different locations, when necessary.

			<b>Konnect Universal Solutions Incorporated product lines can be procured as stand-alone units.
